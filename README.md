# Remote Service Exploit Demo
A vulnerable application (vulnApp) and corresponding exploit (exploit.py) used to demonstrate the Mitre Att&ck technique: Exploiting 
Remote Services. The vulnerability in this case is not checking the length of the user input. 
The attack performed is a buffer overflow and return to libc was used to receive a remote shell to the host running the application. 
The exploit targets a x64 version of this binary.
The binary was compiled with the following command line: </br>
gcc -fno-stack-protector -no-pie -o vulnApp vulnApp.c </br>
Additionally, address space layout randomization was turned off on the computer running this application. </br>
Binary was then run with the following command to enable it over the network </br>
socat TCP-LISTEN:8080,reuseaddr,fork EXEC:./vulnApp
